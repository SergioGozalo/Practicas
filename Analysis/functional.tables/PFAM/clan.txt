CL0001	EGF		EGF superfamily	Finn RD, Bateman A	anon	Members of this clan all belong to the EGF superfamily.  This particular superfamily is characterised as having least 6 cysteine residues.                                                           These cysteines form disulphide bonds, in the order 1-3, 2-4, 5-6, which are essential for the stability of the EGF fold. These  disulphide bonds are stacked in a ladder-like arrangement. The Laminin EGF family is distinguished by having an an additional disulphide bond. The function of the domains within this family remains unclear, but they are thought to largely perform a structural role. More often than not, these domains are arranged in tandem repeats in extracellular proteins.	2016-08-31 16:10:37	2004-03-17 16:02:08	27	1130	21599	962	558007	1	1
CL0003	SAM	NULL	Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain	Finn RD	anon	SAM domains are found in a diverse set of proteins, which include  scaffolding proteins, transcription regulators, translational  regulators tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases [1-3].   SAM domains are found in all eukaryotes and some bacteria [3] .   Structures of SAM domains reveal a common five helical structure.  The SAM domain is involved in a variety of functions. The most widespread function is in domain-domain interactions.   The SAM domain performs domain-domain interactions using multifarious  arrangements of the SAM domain.  More recently, the SAM domain within  the Smaug protein has been demonstrated to bind to the Nanos 3' UTR translation control element (Rfam:RF00161) [3]. This clan currently only represents the diverse SAM domain family and does not contain the more divergent SAM/Pointed family (Pfam:PF02198).	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-03-17 16:21:50	21	336	1916	1587	67197	1	1

CL0009	ENTH_VHS	NULL	ENTH/ANTH/VHS superfamily	Bateman A, McMahon H	anon	This clan includes the related ENTH and ANTH domains as well as the VHS domain. The ENTH domain is approximately 150 residues in length and is a solenoid of alpha-helices. The various ENTH domains have various lipid specificities but the key feature that distinguishes it functionally from ANTH domains is its ability to bend membranes. It does  this by folding an additional N-terminal helix on lipid binding. The ANTH domain is approximately 300 residues in length and is a PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding domain. It has no membrane bending properties. The VHS (Vps-27, Hrs and STAM) domain is a 140 residue long domain present in the very NH2-terminus of at least 60 proteins. Based on their functional characteristics and on recent data on the involvement of VHS in cargo recognition in trans-Golgi, VHS domains are considered to have a general membrane targeting/cargo recognition role in vesicular trafficking [5].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-03-18 10:53:33	20	100	402	1456	24253	1	1
CL0010	SH3	NULL	Src homology-3 domain	Finn RD	anon	Src homology-3 (SH3) domains are comprised of about 60 amino acids, performing either an assembly or regulatory role.\t       For example, SH3 domains in the Grb2 adaptor protein  are essential for protein-protein interactions and\t\t      signal transduction in the p21 Ras-dependent growth factor signaling pathway.  Alternatively, SH3 performs a regulatory role in the Src family of tyrosine kinases. SH3 domains bind a variety of peptide ligands, many of which  contain a PxxP motif.  This PxxP motif is flanked by different specificity elements [1].   Structures of SH3 domains, both free and ligand complexed, have provided insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition. The SH3 fold consists of two anti-parallel beta sheets that lie  at right angles to each other.  Within the fold, there are two variable loops, referred to as RT and n-Src loops.  When SH3 binds to its ligand, the proline rich ligand adopts a PPII helix conformation, with the PPII helix structure recognised by a pair of grooves on the surface of the SH3 domain that  bind turns of the helix.  The SH3 grooves  are formed by a series of nearly parallel, well-conserved aromatic residues [1].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-03-18 11:12:55	21	1538	6860	8337	206136	1	1

CL0040	tRNA_synt_II	NULL	Class II aminoacyl-tRNA and Biotin synthetases	Finn RD	anon	Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are key components of the protein translation  machinery that catalyse two basic reactions. First, the activation of  amino acids via the formation of aminoacyl adenylates and second, linking the activated amino acid to the cognate tRNAs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases generate AMP as the second end product of this reaction, which differentiates them from the majority of ATP-dependent enzymes that produce ADP. In addition, there is a specific  aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases for each of the 20 amino acids and there are  two structurally distinct classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each\t\t  encompassing 10 different specificities. The two classes have alternative modes of aminoacylation: class I aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA; class II aminoacylate 3'OH (with the exception of PheRS). Each class contain a conserved core domain  that is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis and combines with  additional domains that determine the specificity of interactions with\t       the cognate amino acid and tRNA.  The class II core domain consist of a mixed-beta sheet, similar to that found in the biotin synthetases, hence why this family has also been included in  this clan.  The core domain contains three modestly conserved motifs  that are responsible for ATP binding.  The class II aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases can contain additional nested domains, found inserted in the loops of the core domain [1] (and  reference therein).	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-11-08 11:24:57	17	1027	1130	8904	149126	1	1

All of the members perform a pivotal role in signalling events that regulate apoptosis.   Protein-protein interactions are mediated by self-self associations, in which CARD-CARD, DD-DD and  DED-DED contacts are formed exclusively The three families possess remarkably similar structures, each comprising an antiparallel six helical bundle in the Greek Key topology.  Structurally, the DD and CARD families are the most dissimilar.  The former is comprised of two perpendicular three-helix bundles, whereas the latter CARD domain contains six helices that are almost parallel with each other.  Interestingly, the interactions in CARD or DD containing heterodimers are quite different [1]. 	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-11-11 10:28:31	13	660	1736	448	30319	1	1

Thiolases can function either degradatively, in the beta-oxidation  pathway of fatty acids, or biosynthetically. Biosynthetic thiolases  catalyse the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA from two molecules of  acetyl-CoA . This is one of the fundamental categories of carbon  skeletal assembly patterns in biological systems and is the first step  in a wide range of biosynthetic pathways [1].  Thiolase are usually dimeric or tetrameric enzymes.  Within each monomer there are two similar domains related by pseudo dyad.  The N-terminal of these two domains contains a large insertion of about 100 amino  acids.	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-11-15 12:47:24	16	1422	4739	8650	265110	1	1

CL0048	LolA_LolB		LolA/B superfamily	Finn RD, Bateman A	anon	Gram-negative bacteria lipoproteins are anchored to the periplasmic  surface of the inner or outer membrane depending on the sorting signal, which is the residue at position 2 of the polypeptide. Five Lol proteins  are involved in the sorting and membrane localisation of lipoprotein. An ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, LolCDE, releases outer  membrane-specific lipoproteins from the inner membrane, causing the  formation of a complex between the released lipoproteins and the  periplasmic molecular chaperone LolA. When this complex interacts with  outer membrane receptor LolB, the lipoproteins are transferred from LolA  to LolB and then localised to the outer membrane. The structures of LolA  and LolB are remarkably similar to each other. Both have a hydrophobic  cavity consisting of an unclosed beta-barrel and an alpha-helical  lid [1,2].	2015-09-01 10:44:34	2004-11-15 13:13:26	12	68	86	4425	18385	1	1

The chromo domain is a comprised of approximately 50 amino acid residues. There are usually one to three Chromo domains found in a single protein. In some chromo domain containing proteins, a second related chromo domain has been found and is referred to as the Chromo-shadow domain.  The structure of the Chromo and Chromo-shadow domains reveal an OB-fold, a fold found in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleic acid binding proteins.\tMore specifically,the chromo-domain structure reveals a three beta strands that are packed against an alpha helix. Interestingly, a similar structure is found in the archaeal chromatin proteins (7kDa DNA-binding domain).  These are sequence neutral DNA binding proteins.\tThe DNA binding in these archaeal proteins is mediated through the triple stranded beta sheet. These archaeal domains are though to represent an ancestral chromo domain. Homologs of the chromo domain have been found in fission yeast, ciliated protozoa and all animal species, but appear to be absent in eubacteria, budding yeast and plants [2]. The precise function of the chromo domain is unclear, but the chromo domain is thought to act as a targeting module for chromosomal proteins, although the chromosomal contexts and functional contexts being targeted vary.  In all cases studies, the chromo domains are found in proteins that are involved in transcription regulation, positive and negative [2].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-11-16 16:02:09	15	1283	2722	7754	141180	1	1
CL0050	HotDog	NULL	HotDog superfamily	Bateman A	anon	The HotDog fold was first observed in the structure of Escherichia coli beta-hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydratase (FabA), where Leesong et al. noticed that each subunit of this dimeric enzyme contained a mixed alpha + beta 'hot dog' fold. They described the seven-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet as the 'bun', which wraps around a five-turn alpha-helical 'sausage', This superfamily contains a diverse range of enzymes. Membership includes numerous prokaryotic, archaeal and eukaryotic proteins involved in several related, but distinct, catalytic activities, from metabolic roles such as thioester hydrolysis in fatty acid metabolism, to degradation of phenylacetic acid and the environmental pollutant 4-chlorobenzoate. The superfamily also includes FapR, a non-catalytic bacterial homologue that is involved in transcriptional regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis [1].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-11-19 13:30:09	12	1216	3515	8579	136017	1	1

CL0052	NTN	NULL	NTN hydrolase superfamily	Bateman A	anon	In the N-terminal nucleophile aminohydrolases (Ntn hydrolases) the N-terminal residue provides two catalytic groups, nucleophile and proton donor. These enzymes use the side chain of the amino-terminal residue, incorporated in a beta-sheet, as the nucleophile in the catalytic attack at the carbonyl carbon. The nucleophile is cysteine in GAT, serine in penicillin acylase, and threonine in the proteasome. All the enzymes share an unusual fold in which the nucleophile and other catalytic groups occupy equivalent sites. This fold provides both the capacity for nucleophilic attack and the possibility of autocatalytic processing [1].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-11-19 17:25:18	18	11528	1214	8789	136075	1	1

CL0060	DNA_clamp	NULL	DNA clamp superfamily	Bateman A	anon	Sliding DNA clamps are ring-shaped proteins that allow DNA polymerase to achieve high processivity during chromosome replication by tethering the polymerase catalytic subunit to DNA. All of the structures share a 12-fold symmetry around the ring consisting of a simple structural repeat, though there is structural divergence in some of the repeats. Bacterial beta-clamps contain six repeats per subunit with two subunits per ring while the eukaryotic and bacteriophage clamps contain four repeats per subunit with three subunits per ring. Pairs of these repeats form a domain, which has been termed the 'processivity fold'; thus the ring of the sliding clamp contains six domains and therefore is often described as having 6-fold symmetry. A structural representative of a fourth family of processivity fold proteins, namely the herpes simplex virus UL42 protein, is also available. UL42 does not form a ring-shaped clamp, however, but rather functions as a monomer and interacts with DNA quite differently than do sliding clamps; it has been suggested that UL42 resembles a primitive ancestor of sliding clamps [2].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-11-26 17:13:41	12	634	196	9012	35748	1	1

CL0063	NADP_Rossmann		FAD/NAD(P)-binding Rossmann fold Superfamily	Finn RD	anon	A class of redox enzymes are two domain proteins. One domain, termed the catalytic domain, confers substrate specificity and the precise reaction of the enzyme.  The other domain, which is common to this class of redox enzymes, is a Rossmann-fold domain. The Rossmann domain binds nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and it is this cofactor that reversibly accepts a hydride ion, which is lost or gained by the substrate in the redox reaction.  Rossmann domains have an alpha/beta fold, which has a central beta sheet, with approximately five alpha helices found surrounding the beta sheet.The strands forming the beta sheet are found in the following characteristic order 654123. The inter sheet crossover of the stands in the sheet form the NAD+ binding site [1].  In some more distantly relate Rossmann domains the NAD+ cofactor is replaced by the functionally similar cofactor FAD.	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-11-30 13:45:28	25	19578	27270	10369	2609786	1	1

Three of these form a barrel structure and the other three are in a triangular array that caps the barrel. The arrangement of the secondary structures gives the molecules a pseudo 3-fold axis.	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-06 15:34:20	14	1522	2407	3188	62067	1	1

CL0071	His_phosphatase	PGM;	Histidine phosphatase superfamily	Finn RD, Rigden DJ	anon	The histidine phosphatase superfamily is so named because catalysis centres on a conserved His residue that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle.  Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue.\tStructure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue.  The superfamily may be divided into two main branches [1].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-09 14:54:21	12	455	778	8334	75694	1	1

CL0076	FAD_Lum_binding	NULL	Riboflavin synthase/Ferredoxin reductase FAD binding domain	Finn RD	anon	Riboflavin nucleotide coenzymes and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are essential cofactors for a large number of flavoproteins involved in a diverse set of redox reactions.  There are thought to be four different FAD-binding folds [1].The FAD-binding fold of this clan is a cylindrical  beta-fold. More specifically, the domain forms a flattened six-stranded  antiparallel beta-barrel organised into two orthogonal sheets  (1-2-5 and 4-3-6) separated by one alpha-helix. The cylinder is open  between strands strand 4 and 5. This opening of the cylinder makes space  for the isoalloxazine and ribityl moieties of the FAD, to which hydrogen  bonds are formed from the open edges of the strands. The other end of  the cylinder is covered by the only helix of the domain,  which is essential for the binding of the pyrophosphate groups of the  FAD [1].The structural differences in the FAD-binding domain are  manifested mainly as loops of different length and extra extending  structural elements, which may be important for interactions with their  redox partners [1]. The structural core of all clan members is highly  conserved.	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-10 14:19:14	12	219	980	8080	72702	1	1
CL0077	FAD_PCMH	NULL	PCMH-like FAD binding	Finn RD	anon	The FAD-binding domains contained in this family fall within the PCMH (p-cresol methyl-hydroxylase) family of FAD binding proteins as defined in [1].  In this family, the structure of the FAD binding domain is comprised of two subdomains.  Both of these subdomains have an alpha-beta fold.  The first subdomain is comprised of three parallel beta strands,  surrounded by alpha helices.  The second subdomain contains five antiparallel beta strands, also surrounded by alpha helices. The junction between these two subdomains forms the FAD bind pocket, where the ligand is bound by hydrogen and van der Waals bonds [1].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-10 16:27:25	12	509	889	8483	80083	1	1

CL0085	FAD_DHS	NULL	DHS-like NAD/FAD-binding domain	Finn RD	anon	The members of this family adopt a Rossmann fold, similar to CLAN:CL0063. However, the members of this family are distinguished in that the FAD/NAD cofactor is bound in the opposite direction.  In this arrangement, the adenosine moiety is found bound at the  second half of the fold.\t   In addition, the conserved GxGxxG motif found in classical NADP binding Rossmann folds is absent.  Finally, another distinguishing characteristic is the formation of an internal hydrogen bond in the FAD molecule [1].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-16 15:32:59	14	1035	681	8659	73992	1	1
CL0086	FAD_oxidored	NULL	FAD-linked oxidoreductase	Finn RD	anon	The members of this clan adopt a TIM barrel fold, which is reminiscent of flavin mononucleotide binding proteins, rather than one similar to other flavin adenine dinucleotide binding domains.

CL0091	NAD_Ferredoxin	NULL	Ferredoxin / Ferric reductase-like NAD binding	Finn RD	anon	The Ferredoxin / Ferric reductase-like NAD binding domain is  adopts a Rossmann like fold.  However, these families have been excluded from the classical NAD(P) binding Rossmann clan (CLAN:CL0063), due to a divergence of the GxGxxG motif.  In this clan, the motif phosphate binding motif is G-T/S-G-A/I-P.  The changes in the motif are a reflection of the different way that the NAD(P)H is bound by this fold and the classical Rossmann fold [1,2].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-17 14:54:00	12	350	965	7792	62741	1	1
CL0092	ADF	NULL	Actin depolymerizing Factor	Finn RD	anon	For motile cells such as Amoeba to move, there must be the rapid recycling of their actin cytoskeleton to enable a dynamic change in their shape. Gelsolin (PFAM:PF00626) and Cofilin (PFAM:PF00241) are  two key domain families in this process.  Both of these domain are  structural and functional similar [1,2].

CL0097	TypeIII_Chap	NULL	Type III secretory system chaperone	Finn RD	anon	The translocation of pathogenic proteins into a host cell is mediated by the type III secretory system. A component of this system is a  chaperone, which binds to the protein which is going to be secreted in the bacterial cytosol and is involved in translocation of the secreted  protein, although the chaperone is not translocated itself. An individual  chaperone associates with one or two specific proteins [1].  There are a large number of type III secretory system chaperones, which are small acidic proteins and exhibit significant sequence divergence.   This clan groups type III secretory system chaperones. Members with a  known structure form small compact globular domains with an alpha-beta(3)- alpha-beta(2)-alpha like organisation [1].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-22 12:58:31	12	109	104	4161	8049	1	1
CL0098	SPOUT	AB_Knot;	SPOUT Methyltransferase Superfamily	Finn RD	anon	A distinct class of methylases that includes the SpoU and TrmD  superfamilies and two superfamilies of predicted methylases defined  by the YbeA and MJ0421 proteins in bacteria and archaea,  respectively [1] (PFAM:PF00588 PFAM:PF01746). SPOUT is  structurally  distinct  compared to more classical methyltransferases [1]. More specifically, the members of this clan form alpha/beta knots. Knots are extremely rare in protein structures as they pose a\tfolding problem. The mechanism that allow a domain to be folded as a knot are unclear, but are discussed in [2] and reference therein. All members with known structure form homodimers.	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-22 15:38:51	14	486	318	8836	63549	1	1
CL0099	ALDH-like	NULL	ALDH-like superfamily	Finn RD	anon	The aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are a superfamily of multimeric  enzymes which catalyse the oxidation of a broad range of aldehydes into  their corresponding carboxylic acids with the reduction of their cofactor, NAD(P) into NAD(P)H.  The way that the NAD is bound is distinct from other NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases.  The domain represented by this  clan consists of two similar subdomains.	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-22 15:45:47	13	1593	764	8587	128165	1	1
CL0100	C1q_TNF	NULL	C1q and TNF superfamily	Finn RD	anon	The members of the C1q and TNF superfamily are involved in a diverse set  of functions, which include: defense, inflammation, apoptosis, autoimmunity differentiation, organogenesis, hibernation and insulin-resistant\tobesity [1].  Both C1q and TNF domains form a compact jelly-roll beta- sandwich.  The core of these structures are conserved between the two families and corresponds to the detectable sequence similarity. Proteins containing both of these domains, form trimers before they are active.  However, the surfaces of the domains are quite different and  this difference is thought to give rise to the function difference between the clan members[1].  	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2004-12-22 15:46:56	13	536	231	647	14617	1	1

CL0108	Actin_ATPase	NULL	Actin-like ATPase Superfamily	Finn RD	anon	The actin-like ATPase domain forms an alpha/beta canonical fold. The domain can be subdivided into 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B subdomains. Subdomains 1A and 1B share the same RNAseH-like fold (a five-stranded beta-sheet decorated by a number of alpha-helices). Domains 1A and 2A are conserved in all members of this superfamily, whereas domain 1B and 2B have a variable structure and are even missing from some homologues [1].  Within the actin-like ATPase domain the ATP-binding site is highly conserved. The phosphate part of the ATP is bound in a cleft between subdomains 1A and 2A, whereas the adenosine moiety is bound to residues from domains 2A and 2B[1].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2005-03-22 09:34:28	16	2789	2204	9024	319796	1	1
CL0109	CDA		Cytidine deaminase-like (CDA) superfamily	Finn RD, Coin L, Iyer LM, Zhang D, Aravind L	anon	This clan contains both free nucleotide and nucleic acid deaminases that act on adenosine, cytosine, guanine and cytidine, and are  collectively known as the deaminase superfamily.  The conserved fold  consists of a three-layered alpha/beta/alpha structure with 3 helices  and 4 strands in the 2134 order [1,2].This superfamily is further  divided into two major divisions based on the presence of a  helix (helix-4) that renders the terminal strands (strands 4 and 5) either parallel to each other in its presence, or anti-parallel  in its absence [2]. Structurally, the deaminase-like fold is present in four other superfamilies including the JAB-like metalloproteins,  the C-terminal AICAR transformylase-catalyzing domains of PurH,  Tm1506 and the formate dehydrogenase accessory subunit FdhD. The active site of the deaminases is composed of three residues  that coordinate a zinc ion between conserved helices 2 and 3. The  residues are typically found as [HCD]xE and CxxC motifs at the  beginning of helices 2 and 3. The zinc ion activates a water  molecule, which forms a tetrahderal intermediate with the carbon  atom that is linked to the amine group. This is followed by  deamination of the base.  	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2005-03-22 09:57:40	12	449	3433	9094	79530	1	1

CL0118	Ribokinase	NULL	Ribokinase-like superfamily	Bateman A	anon	All of these enzymes are phosphotransferases that have an alcohol group as an acceptor (EC:2.7.1.-). However, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate kinase (HMPP kinase) catalyses two phosphorylation reactions: one to a hydroxymethyl group of hydroxymethyl pyrimidine (HMP) and the second to the phosphomethyl group of HMPP [1]. The common structural feature for the enzymes in this superfamily is a central eight-stranded sheet that is flanked by eight structurally conserved helices, five on one side and three on the other [1]. The active site is located in a shallow groove along one edge of the sheet, with the phosphate acceptor hydroxyl group and -phosphate of ATP close together in the middle of the groove, and substrate and ATP binding at the ends [1].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2005-04-01 13:48:37	12	706	540	8712	79309	1	1
CL0121	Cystatin		Cystatin-like superfamily	Bateman A	anon	This superfamily includes cystatins and cathelicidins [1]. The cystatin superfamily comprises cysteine protease inhibitors that play key regulatory roles in protein degradation processes. The progenitor of this superfamily was most probably intracellular and lacked a signal peptide and disulfide bridges, much like the extant Giardia cystatin. A primordial gene duplication produced two ancestral eukaryotic lineages, cystatins and stefins. Stefins - included in Pfam:PF00031 - remain encoded by a single or a small number of genes throughout the eukaryotes, whereas the cystatins have undergone a more complex and dynamic evolution through numerous gene and domain duplications [2].	2008-09-03 16:50:29	2005-04-05 16:56:37	12	162	390	2649	13422	1	1

CL0362	RAMPS-Cas5-like		CRISPR-associated (Cas) Repair Associated Mysterious Proteins	Bateman A, Coggill P	anon	This group of families is one of several protein families that are always found associated with prokaryotic CRISPRs, themselves a family of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, DNA repeats found in nearly half of all bacterial and archaeal genomes. These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called spacers, sit between each pair of repeats [1]. It has been shown that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation [2]. Cas5 contains an endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers [3].	2009-05-08 21:09:23	NULL	4	359	50	2707	11146	1	1

CL0567	Phage_TACs		Phage tail assembly chaperone	Davidson A, Coggill P	pcc	This superfamily is characterised by only distantly related families of tail assembly chaperones or TACs. Most bacteriophages possess a long tail that is either contractile as in the Siphoviridae family or contractile as in the Myoviridae family. TACs are required for the morphogenesis of all long-tailed phages.  All the studied TACs form spiral quaternary rings that have arisen through diverging sequences and oligomerisation mechanisms. The proposed function in all cases, however, is for the TAC to coat the tape-measure protein to prevent it from forming unproductive complexes or precipitating before the tail tube protein has been incorporated [1,2].	2013-08-29 14:35:23	2013-08-29 14:35:23	2	3	26	2065	3823	1	1

CL0569	Phage_TTPs		Phage tail tube proteins superfamily	Coggill P	pcc	This superfamily represents families of phage tail tube proteins TTPs. Most bacteriophages possess a long tail that is either non-contractile as in the Siphoviridae family or contractile as in the Myoviridae family. These multi-component structures are assembled in regulated pathways that commence with the formation of the tail tip. Tail tip complexes, also referred to as baseplates in some phages, vary considerably in size and protein composition, but all probably serve as the initiator of tail tube protein polymerisation. The tube protein in each case is a long tubular strucutre through which the viral DNA passes during infection. The tube is created by polymerisation of the tube single tube protein. Contractile tails include a central tail tube protein (TTP) that is surrounded by a tail sheath protein (TSP). On infection, the tail sheath contracts and the TTP penetrates the outer cell membrane and cell wall [1,2,3].	2013-08-30 13:11:01	2013-08-30 13:11:01	2	258	40	3151	6094	1	1

CL0654	WYL		WYL-like superfamily	Richardson L	lornar	Members of this clan all belong to the WYL-like superfamily, and  show structural similarity to the Sm-like SH3 beta-barrel fold. The WYL domain was first named for three conserved amino acids, however this motif was subsequently shown to be found only in a small subset of examples of this clan. The conservation pattern more widely applicable across the clan includes four basic residues and a position often occupied by a cysteine. These residues are predicted  to line a ligand-binding groove similar to that found in Sm-like SH3  beta-barrels. WYL domains often occur in two copies in the same protein, or are encoded alongside neighbouring genes that encode multi-WYL domain proteins, and it has been suggested that they form toroidal multimeric assemblies. WYL domains are often associated with various predicted DNA-binding N-terminal wHTH domains, but may also exist as fusions to several enzymatic domains.	2016-08-31 16:04:18	2016-08-31 15:02:46	1	4	79	5477	18936	1	1

CL0656	VSA		Variant surface antigens	El-Gebali S	selgebali	Members of this clan belong to variant surface antigens (VSA). They are gene products encoded by multi-copy gene families. Four of the largest multi-copy gene families found in the genome of P. falciparum are designated as var, rif (repetitive interspersed family), stevor (subtelomeric variable open reading frame) and pfmc-2tm (P. falciparum Maurer's clefts 2 transmembrane). They code for variable proteins termed PfEMP1 (P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1), RIFIN, STEVOR and PfMC-2TM, respectively. All small VSA proteins contain a signal peptide and a PEXEL/HT motif. This characteristic as well as their large number and hypervariability support their suggested role in antigenic variation. Antigenic variation and sequestration are strategies used by the malaria parasite P. falciparum to evade antibody mediated immune recognition and splenic clearance [1].	2017-03-10 11:53:21	2016-09-27 15:57:09	1	1	42	23	2211	1	1

CL0659	CAP		Cysteine-rich secretory proteins	El-Gebali S	selgebali	This is a highly evolutionary diversified protein superfamily whose members share specific sequence motifs. For the mammalian members, roles in reproduction, development, immune function and several pathologies have been proposed. Ant and wasp allergens, snake venom toxins and plant antifungal proteins are included in this superfamily data suggest that CAP proteins participate in various biological activities across phyla. Several signature sequences characterize mammalian members of the superfamily: CAP1-2 and CAP3-4, variable Cys-rich hinge regions and Ct extensions. Mammalian CAPs include nine subfamilies: cysteine rich secretory proteins (CRISPs), glioma pathogenesis related-1 (GLIPR1), glioma pathogenesis related-2 (GLIPR2)/Golgi, associated pathogenesis related-1 (GAPR1), peptidase inhibitor 15 (PI15), peptidase inhibitor 16 (PI16), CRISP LCCL domain containing 1 and 2 (CRISPLD1/CAPLD1 and CRISPLD2/CAPLD2), mannose receptor-like/CP domain, CTL domain containing (CAPCL) and the R3H domain-like protein (R3HMDL). CRISP (cysteine rich secretory proteins) proteins (venom-related proteins, and proteins produced by reproductive organs and cells) and plant-derived pathogenesis related proteins are the best characterized. Helminth parasite proteins of this superfamily were first reported in hookworms and later in related nematodes and platyhelminths. While nematodes' CAP proteins are known as Ancylostoma secreted proteins (ASPs), platyhelminths' CAP are known as venom allergen-like (VAL) proteins. Some of these proteins have been studied as vaccine candidates due to their immunogenic and protective properties (e.g. Na-ASP-2, Ov-Asp1, Oo-ASP-1) [1].	2017-01-11 16:08:48	2017-01-11 16:08:48	1	74	644	5292	26055	1	1

CL0676	SLATT		SMODS and LOG-Smf/DprA-Associating Two TM	El-Gebali S	selgebali	Members of the SLATT clan carry two transmembrane (TM) helices and are found to frequently link the SMODS and SLOG domains. Sequence analysis indicate the presence of a conserved core for the domain consisting of a pair of N-terminal TM helices and a largely helical C-terminal cytoplasmic region. The TM helices often contain family-specific polar residues that are likely to form an intramembrane aqueous channel that might facilitate transport of molecules across the membrane [1].	2017-07-25 15:35:04	2017-07-25 15:35:04	1	0	38	1298	2391	1	1
CL0677	GHMP_C		GHMP C-terminal domain superfamily	El-Gebali S	selgebali	The GHMP kinases are a group of structurally related small kinases which are mostly involved in intermediary metabolism. The group is named after four members - galactokinase, homserine kinase, mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase. It also includes 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase, isopentenyl monophosphate kinase, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase, archaeal shikimate kinases, N-acetyl galactosamine kinase, L-threonine kinase, glucuronokinase and galacturonic acid kinase. In addition to these enzymes, two proteins without catalytic activity - the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional regulator, Gal3p and the Caenorhabditis elegans sex fate determining protein XOL-1 have similar folds [1]. Of the seven enzymes, six kinases and one decarboxylase, two have been linked to human disease, two are involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic and nonaromatic amino acids, folates, and ubiquinones, one is needed to deliver galactose to the glycolytic pathway, and four are essential for either the mevalonate- or non-mevalonate-dependent synthesis of isoprenoids. The structural scaffold of the family has been evolutionary maintained, while the residues have been allowed to drift, however there are highly conserved solvent-accessible residues that are characteristic of the GHMP kinase family [2]. This clan represents the structurally conserved C-terminal domain which has a central alpha-beta plait fold and an insertion of four helices. Together with the N-terminal fold it creates a nucleotide binding fold with the active site located at the domain interface [3].	2017-09-19 13:31:35	2017-09-19 13:31:35	1	253	209	8225	25208	1	1
CL0678	CLIP		CLIP domain superfamily	El-Gebali S	selgebali	CLIP proteases are non-digestive serine proteases present in hemolymph of insects and other arthropods. They are composed of one or more amino-terminal clip domains followed by a linker sequence and a carboxyl-terminal S1A family serine protease domain. Infections can stimulate activation of CLIP protease zymogens in hemolymph, with specific cleavage at a site at the amino-terminus of the protease domain, creating a two-chain form active form of the enzyme, in which the clip domain and protease domain remain connected by a disulfide bond. Once CLIP proteases are activated, they participate in cascade pathways to trigger activation of prophenoloxidase (proPO) or the Toll ligand spÃ¤tzle and are regulated by serpin inhibitors in hemolymph plasma. Some members of the CLIP superfamily contain a protease domain with mutations of one or more of the catalytic triad residues (i.e. pseudoproteases), such that they lack proteolytic activity. Such serine protease homologs (SPH) can function as cofactors required for proPO activation by an active CLIP protease, and they can also negatively regulate the melanization response. Clip domain sequences fall into three major groups based on sequence similarity and the distance between certain Cys residues. These clip domain groups are labeled types 1, 2, and 3, with three subgroups identified in type 1 (1a, 1b, 1c). There is a conserved association of certain clip domain types with protease domain types, indicating a co-evolution of distinct combinations of the clip domain and protease domain types. There are conserved Cys1 and Cys5, Cys2 and Cys4, and Cys3 and Cys6 which are predicted to form three disulfide bonds [1].	2017-09-21 16:55:02	2017-09-21 16:55:02	1	5	81	91	1736	1	1
CL0679	TACC		Transforming acidic coiled-coil	El-Gebali S	selgebali	TACC proteins are present in different organisms, ranging from yeasts to mammals. For example, TACC proteins can be found in: Caenorhabditis elegans (TAC-1), Drosophila melanogaster (D-TACC), Xenopus laevis (Maskin), and in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Alp7 also known as Mia1p); by contrast, mammals have three such proteins (TACC1, TACC2 [also known as AZU-1 and ECTACC] and TACC3 [also known as AINT and ERIC1]). Alternative splicing further increases the complexity of the TACC protein family in mammals and flies . The first member of the TACC family to be discovered was identified in a search of genomic regions that are amplified in breast cancer. It was named transforming acidic coiled-coil 1 (TACC1) because of its highly acidic nature, the presence of a predicted coiled-coil domain at its C terminus (now known as the TACC domain), and its ability to promote cellular transformation. one of the extensively characterised TACC proteins, Maskin acts as a factor involved in the regulation of mRNA translation during maturation of Xenopus oocytes. Other TACC family members have also been implicated in various events related to gene regulation, including the regulation of translation, RNA maturation and gene expression. Furthermore, TACC proteins have a role in regulating microtubule assembly such as D-TACC which acts as a Drosophila microtubule-associated and centrosomal protein required for centrosome activity and microtubule assembly during mitosis [1].	2017-10-09 11:35:17	2017-10-09 11:35:17	1	22	30	861	2231	1	1
CL0680	WW		WW domain	El-Gebali S	selgebali	The WW domain is composed of 38 to 40 semi-conserved amino acids. They are found in many human proteins and play integral roles in systems connected to the appearance of Alzheimerâ€™s, Huntingtonâ€™s, muscular dystrophy, and cancer. In particular, loss-of-function mutations that disrupt WW domainâ€“ligand interactions can lead to major complications. WW domains fold into a three-stranded beta sheet that binds polyproline motifs. They have been divided into four main classes, corresponding to the polyproline motif with which they interact: class 1 with PPxY motifs, class 2 with PPPL/R motifs, class 3 with (PxxGMxPP)*2 motifs, and class 4 with (pS/pT)P motifs (p=phosphorylation) [1].	2017-11-15 14:55:48	2017-11-15 14:55:48	1	217	1236	1460	46632	1	1
CL0681	HAMP		HAMP domains	El-Gebali S	selgebali	The ability of single-celled organisms to sense, respond to, and adapt to their changing environment requires receptor proteins to convert extracellular signals into cellular responses. Central to many of these signal transduction systems are HAMP (histidine kinases, adenylyl cyclases, methylaccepting proteins, and other prokaryotic signaling proteins) domains, which act to couple sensory and output domains in different receptor proteins. In transmembrane receptors, HAMP domains connect to transmembrane helices entering the cytoplasm and translate chemical, photo, and thermo stimuli to the output of cytoplasmic catalytic domains (mainly histidine kinases, adenylyl cyclases, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins [MCPs], and phosphatases). Deletion of HAMP domains disrupts the link between input and output units, generating receptors incapable of switching activity states upon stimulation. HAMP domains are small modules, approximately 50 amino acids, that dimerize to form an entirely parallel four-helix bundle with two helices (AS1 and AS2) supplied from each subunit. The AS1 and AS2 helices form a seven-residue pattern characteristic of coiled coils, termed a heptad repeat [1].	2018-01-11 11:05:45	2018-01-11 11:05:45	1	101	3023	7302	109088	1	1

CL0683	MICOS		Mitochondrial contact site complex	El-Gebali S	selgebali	Mitofilin proteins are crucial organizers of mitochondrial architecture. They are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and interact with several protein complexes of the outer membrane, thereby generating contact sites between the two membrane systems of mitochondria. They are part of hetero-oligomeric protein complexes that have been termed the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS), alternatively, mitochondrial organizing structure (MitOS) or mitochondrial contact site (MICOS) complex [1]. MICOS interacts with components of the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) complex of the outer membrane to form the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging (MIB) complex [2].	2018-02-26 16:04:32	2018-02-26 16:04:32	1	0	10	784	941	1	1

Several phages possess both a clade-1 aG/PT-pyrophoshorylase domain and a clade-2 protein [1].	2018-06-27 12:02:27	2018-06-27 12:02:27	1	0	15	319	428	1	1

The BECR fold of metal-independent endoRNases are commonly observed and extensively diversified effectors across diverse prokaryotic conflict systems such as polymorphic toxin systems, plasmid-encoded bacteriocins, and TA systems. Although BECR fold proteins are often extensively elaborated with inserts or show structural modifications, they share a conserved core of an N-terminal helix followed by four or five strands. In addition to their presence in polyvalent proteins, solo versions of these BECR domains are also found in phages; we accordingly designate this clade the phage-BECR (PBECR) domains [1].	2018-07-09 13:27:05	2018-07-09 13:27:05	1	0	126	582	875	1	1

CL0699	EAD1		EAD1-like clan	Aravind L, Iyer LM	agb	Effector-associated domains (EADs) are predicted to function as adaptor domains mediating protein-protein interactions. The EADs show a characteristic architectural pattern. One copy is always fused, typically to the N- or C-terminus, of a core component of a biological conflict system; examples include VMAP, iSTAND, or GAP1.  Further copies of the same EAD are fused to either effector or signal-transducing domains, or additional EADs. EAD pairs are frequently observed together on the genome in conserved gene neighborhoods, but can also be severed from such neighborhoods and located in distant regions, indicating the EAD-EAD coupling approximates the advantages of collinear transcription.
